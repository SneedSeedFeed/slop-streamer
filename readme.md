# slop-streamer
My personal utilities for streaming and requesting slop from AI providers. Because async-openai is too much for me but I also hate writing schemas myself yet end up doing it myself in every project when I could have just wrote one project that has those schemas how I like them sitting waiting for me.

Also contains some experiments in trait based API requests and probably some other rubbish eventually.

I would WTFPL it but I'm trying to pretend to be a good corporate boy this year.
